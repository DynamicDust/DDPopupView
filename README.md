DDPopupView
===========

A simple UIView which behaves like a popup on iPhone and iPad.


### Roadmap
These are the things I would like to work on, to make this class better.

- [ ] Separated overlay and popup views  
- [ ] More animation easing functions (now only bounceIn and bounceOut)  
- [ ] Whatever... just improvements!
